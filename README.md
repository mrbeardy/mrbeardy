### Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

Here you'll find some of the projects I've been working on. My aim is to release most of them open-source, but I've got a fair bit of work to do to clean them up for release. If you're interested in any of the projects, feel free to [Start a new Discussion](https://github.com/mrbeardy/mrbeardy/discussions)!

# Game Development

## Together

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrbeardy/mrbeardy/main/img/TogetherCover1920x1080.png)

Together is the latest project I'm working on, using Unreal Engine 4. It's a co-op puzzle game where you play as Teito (He's a potato) and Tina (She's a Turnip, Tina Turnip).

The concepts for the characters are based on [characters created by Karina Ballote on Behance](https://www.behance.net/gallery/107406713/Teito-and-Sid).

Originally the characters had a cartoon-like appearance to match the concept art, but after a happy accident during texturing I fell in love with the fabric-style look for them. This also offers up a good game-design element for secret collectable materials that the players can find and switch up their appearance as they play through the game.

This project has been the first chance I've gotten to fully model and texture characters, including (through pain) rigging for animation. The process has been challenging, but ultimately incredibly rewarding. I don't think I could have fallen in love with characters that I didn't have a hand in creating, and it has definitely given me a bigger passion to create a fun world for them to roam around in.

Anni was a one-year anniversary present for my girlfriend. In the game, you play as Anni the Fox and as you explore the world, you uncover a timeline of still-life memories from our relationship.

The video is from an early demo recorded during development. The final product had an intro screen and voice-overs, which gave me the chance to experiment with story-telling and different Unity features such as Cinemachine and Timelines.

## âƒŸ (Dreams - PS4)

[Demo on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-yxlT7Pa-s) &middot; [Dreams link](https://indreams.me/dream/mgXuQRtdobu)

This was a game I created in Dreams for their 30-seconds Game Jam. The idea behind the game was that you only have 30 seconds to complete the level, and you have to get as far as you can before the timer runs out. The more times you play through the level, the faster you can complete each of the challenges, and ultimately get to the end before the timer runs out.

I was trying to give a feel for what it's like to speed-run, where players play the same game over and over until they become fast enough to beat it in record breaking time.

I had plans to add multiple levels to the game, but ran short on time (#irony). I'm still proud of the end result, and I feel like I've created a vertical-slice that can be expanded in the future if I ever decide to come back to the concept.

## Defuse

Defuse was a remake of Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes. I started the project after thinking of some games that we could play as a team before retrospectives at On the Beach.

In the end, I got something playable with a Simon Says and a Symbols module. The plan was to open-source it, but currently the logic in the remake works alongside the manual from the original game.

My end goal for this is it to clean up what I have and open source it, and then come back to this concept in the future with a new and unique game that isn't tied to Keep Talking.

## Baba is Unity

As a challenge (and to satisfy my appetite for remaking game mechanics) I made a small remake of Baba is You in Unity.

I got part of the base mechanics working, but my fairly limited C# experience ended up as a blocker. I'd love to come back and pick this project back up again.

## Map System

As a challenge to release something on the Unity Asset Store, I set out to create a Map System for Unity.

The project became fairly more complicated than I'd initially anticipated, and after encountering a strange bug (that caused errors to appear in the console whenever scripts were recompiled while the in-editor game was running) I paused the project.

I'm proud of what I ended up with, and would ultimately like to come back to it and release it, but it'll require rewriting and updating with things I've learned since I was working on the project.

## Base Building Utility

This was a simple base building utility I was working on as an experiment after playing No Mans Sky. I never ended up doing anything with it, but I may come back to it in the future and pick it back up as a package.
