Anni was a one-year anniversary present for my girlfriend. In the game, you play as Anni the Fox and as you explore the world, you uncover a timeline of still-life memories from our relationship.

The video is from an early demo recorded during development. The final product had an intro screen and voice-overs, which gave me the chance to experiment with story-telling and different Unity features such as Cinemachine and Timelines.

## Map Systm

As a challenge to release something on the Unity Asset Store, I set out to create a Map System for Unity.

The project became fairly more complicated than I'd initially anticipated, and after encountering a strange bug (that caused errors to appear in the console whenever scripts were recompiled while the in-editor game was running) I paused the project.

I'm proud of what I ended up with, and would ultimately like to come back to it and release it, but it'll require rewriting and updating with things I've learned since I was working on the project.

## Base Building Utility

This was a simple base building utility I was working on as an experiment after playing No Mans Sky. I never ended up doing anything with it, but I may come back to it in the future and pick it back up as a package.
