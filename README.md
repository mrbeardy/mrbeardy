Anni was a one-year anniversary present for my girlfriend. In the game, you play as Anni the Fox and as you explore the world, you uncover a timeline of still-life memories from our relationship.

The video is from an early demo recorded during development. The final product had an intro screen and voice-overs, which gave me the chance to experiment with story-telling and different Unity features such as Cinemachine and Timelines.

## Base Building Utility

This was a simple base building utility I was working on as an experiment after playing No Mans Sky. I never ended up doing anything with it, but I may come back to it in the future and pick it back up as a package.
