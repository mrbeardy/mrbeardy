Anni is a short story-game I created as a One-year anniversary present for my Girlfriend. 

In the game, you play as Anni the Fox, exploring the world and uncovering different "moments" that play out as a timeline of momentous events throughout our relationship.

This was a simple base building utility I was working on as a challenge. It wasn't tied to any particular project.
