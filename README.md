### Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

Here you'll find some of the projects I've been working on. My aim is to release all of them open-source, but I've got a fair bit of work to do to clean them up for release. If you're interested in any of the projects, feel free to [Start a new Discussion](https://github.com/mrbeardy/mrbeardy/discussions)!

# Game Development

Anni was a one-year anniversary present for my girlfriend. In the game, you play as Anni the Fox and as you explore the world, you uncover a timeline of still-life memories from our relationship.

The video is from an early demo recorded during development. The final product had an intro screen and voice-overs, which gave me the chance to experiment with story-telling and different Unity features such as Cinemachine and Timelines.

## Baba is Unity

As a challenge (and to satisfy my appetite for remaking game mechanics) I made a small remake of Baba is You in Unity.

I got part of the base mechanics working, but my fairly limited C# experience ended up as a blocker. I'd love to come back and pick this project back up again.

## âƒŸ (Dreams - PS4)

[Demo on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-yxlT7Pa-s) &middot; [Dreams link](https://indreams.me/dream/mgXuQRtdobu)

This was a game I created in Dreams for their 30-seconds Game Jam. The idea behind the game was that you only have 30 seconds to complete the level, and you have to get as far as you can before the timer runs out. The more times you play through the level, the faster you can complete each of the challenges, and ultimately get to the end before the timer runs out.

I was trying to give a feel for what it's like to speed-run, where players play the same game over and over until they become fast enough to beat it in record breaking time.

I had plans to add multiple levels to the game, but ran short on time (#irony). I'm still proud of the end result, and I feel like I've created a vertical-slice that can be expanded in the future if I ever decide to come back to the concept.

## Map System

As a challenge to release something on the Unity Asset Store, I set out to create a Map System for Unity.

The project became fairly more complicated than I'd initially anticipated, and after encountering a strange bug (that caused errors to appear in the console whenever scripts were recompiled while the in-editor game was running) I paused the project.

I'm proud of what I ended up with, and would ultimately like to come back to it and release it, but it'll require rewriting and updating with things I've learned since I was working on the project.

## Base Building Utility

This was a simple base building utility I was working on as an experiment after playing No Mans Sky. I never ended up doing anything with it, but I may come back to it in the future and pick it back up as a package.
